Pressure alt:
    The height above a standard datum plane (SDP), which is a theoretical level
    where the weight of the atmosphere is equal to 1013.2 mbar as measured by
    a barometer.

QNH alt:
    The height above a standard datum plane (SDP), which is a theoretical level
    where the weight of the atmosphere is equal to the qnh value as measured
    by a barometer.

Barometric formula:
    A formula used to model how the pressure (or density)
    of the air changes with alt. The pressure drops approximately by
    11.3 Pa per meter in first 1000 meters above sea level

International Standard Atmosphere:
    The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is a static atmospheric model
    of how the pressure, temperature, density, and viscosity of the Earth's
    atmosphere change over a wide range of alts or elevations. It has been
    established to provide a common reference for temperature and pressure and
    consists of tables of values at various alts, plus some formulas by
    which those values were derived.


Let P be the pressure at alt h and P_0 be the pressure at alt=0.

P = P_0 * ((T / (T + L*(h-h_0)))^(1/K).

Because the QNH is the pressure corresponding to 0 meters for a certain day,
we get:

P = QNH * ((T / (T + L*h))^(1/K)

K = R * L / (g * M) = 0.190266

R = 8.3144598 J/(molÂ·K) (Universal Gas constant)
L = 0.0065 K/m (Standard ICAO atmosphere lapse rate)
g = 9.80665 m/s2 (Gravitational acceleration)
M = 0.0289644 kg/mol (Molar mass of Earth's air)
T = 288.15 K

To calculate the height for a given Pressure and QNH:

h = (T/L) * (QNH/P)^K - 1)
